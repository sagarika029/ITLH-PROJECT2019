		<p>WHY UNDANDY IS BETTER FOR YOU <br> THAN TINDER</p>

	<div class="undandy-text">
		<p>the magic of modern technology, with an inexhaustible stream of cat vines, <br>Tesco food deliveries and convenient banking at your fingertips. Whatever you want, <br>the internet can provide it. But all these limitless options can start to get a bit exhausting,<br> and no more so than when it comes to the dating world. With now over 100 million <br> Tinder downloads and 12% of married active users since the app launched, it’s no wonder that <br> swiping through countless profiles on Tinder can leave you cold. The perils of limitless<br> options have long been extolled, but it seems like only now we’re heeding that advice.<br> The ‘grass is greener’ dating culture that we are cultivating is bound to end in disappointment.<br> No-one can possibly live up to the perfect partner you’ve created in your imagination.<br> The illusive woman out there with the perfect gym honed body who isn’t self-absorbed,<br> the beauty with brains, who also just happens to enjoy exactly <br>the same hobbies as you and doesn’t nag like your mother.</p>

	<div class="undandy-text2">
		<p>However, with our 3D customiser you can design from head to toe, the perfect, <br>timeless pair of shoes for you. Until Tinder comes up with that, it’s far wiser to trust Undandy<br> to help you find your solemate. Although no promises that is any less addictive, after all there
		 <br>is no known cure for shoe addiction.</p>
